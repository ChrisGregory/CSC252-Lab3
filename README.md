Dots and Boxes is a simple yet fascinating game when it comes down to what strategies work to regularly beat your opponent.  You may not think it, but there is strategy (and good strategy at that!) to regularly blowing your friends and neighbors out of the proverbial water.

Outline

Dots and Boxes is a game where you start with a grid of dots.  Each person takes a turn by drawing a line from one horizontal or vertical line to an adjacent dot.  Players draw these lines with the intent of capturing boxes.  Once four lines connect to make a square, whoever drew the fourth line will “capture” that box.  Each time a player captures a square, he is required to place an additional line on the grid.  The game ends when there are no lines left to draw; the winner is the one who captured the most boxes.
